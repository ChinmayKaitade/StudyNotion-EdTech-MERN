import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const initialState = {
  user: localStorage.getItem("user")
    ? JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user"))
    : null,
};

// Problem occurred and solved
// initially i mark user data as null
// as i refresh the page user becomes null , so login / signup buttons are not visible - In case of user not logged
// case - User logged but as i refresh , dashboard dropdown becomes invisible
// solution - try getting value from localStorage otherwise mark it as null
